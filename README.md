# Python-based-simple-music-player
This project is a simple music player, which will help you to learn about basic libraries and their functions. This code can be modified per requirement. We have utilized libraries like tkinter, PIL, Pygame, mutagen.mp3, and Playsound. This will give you a basic knowledge of using libraries to create simple projects.
While running this code, ensure that you have created a folder that has all the songs you need. I have used these simple png images for the buttons, you can create your own and use it.
